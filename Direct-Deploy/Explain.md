### Let's break down each component of this Kubernetes YAML manifest line by line:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mongo-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  hostPath:
    path: /home/ubuntu/mongo/mongo-vol
```

- `apiVersion`: Specifies the version of the Kubernetes API that this object uses.
- `kind`: Specifies the type of Kubernetes object being defined, in this case, a PersistentVolume.
- `metadata`: Contains metadata about the PersistentVolume, such as its name.
- `spec`: Defines the specification of the PersistentVolume.
  - `capacity`: Specifies the amount of storage required for the PersistentVolume.
  - `accessModes`: Specifies the access modes for the PersistentVolume. In this case, it's set to ReadWriteOnce, meaning the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
  - `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy`: Defines the policy for what happens to the volume when released. Here it's set to Retain, meaning the volume is not deleted automatically when the associated claim is deleted.
  - `hostPath`: Specifies that the volume is backed by a directory on the host. It defines the path on the host machine (`/home/ubuntu/mongo/mongo-vol`) that will be mounted as a volume in the container.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mongo-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

- This defines a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that will be used by a pod to claim storage resources.
- `metadata`: Contains metadata about the PersistentVolumeClaim, such as its name.
- `spec`: Defines the specification of the PersistentVolumeClaim.
  - `accessModes`: Specifies the access modes for the PersistentVolumeClaim. Similar to the PersistentVolume definition, it's set to ReadWriteOnce.
  - `resources`: Defines the requested resources for the PersistentVolumeClaim.
    - `requests`: Specifies the requested storage, which is 1Gi in this case.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mongodb-configmap
data:
  db_host: mongodb-service
```

- This defines a ConfigMap object, which allows you to store configuration data in key-value pairs.
- `metadata`: Contains metadata about the ConfigMap, such as its name.
- `data`: Specifies the actual data stored in the ConfigMap. In this case, it contains a key-value pair where the key is `db_host` and the value is `mongodb-service`.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mongodb-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=
  password: MTIz
```

- This defines a Secret object, which allows you to store sensitive information securely, such as passwords or tokens.
- `metadata`: Contains metadata about the Secret, such as its name.
- `type`: Specifies the type of secret. In this case, it's set to Opaque, which means arbitrary data can be stored securely.
- `data`: Specifies the actual data stored in the Secret. The data is base64 encoded. There are two key-value pairs: `username` and `password`, each with their corresponding encoded values.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mongo-express-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  mduser: YWRtaW4=
  mdpass: MTIz
  meuser: YWRtaW4=
  mepass: MTIz
```

- Similar to the previous Secret definition, this defines another Secret object named `mongo-express-secret`.
- It also has the type `Opaque` and contains four key-value pairs: `mduser`, `mdpass`, `meuser`, and `mepass`, each with their corresponding base64 encoded values.

        - `volumeMounts`: Mounts the persistent volume (`mongo-data`) to the container at the path `/data/db`.
      - `volumes`: Specifies the volumes to be mounted into the pod. In this case, it mounts the persistent volume claim (`mongo-pvc`) as `mongo-data`.

```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongodb-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mongodb
